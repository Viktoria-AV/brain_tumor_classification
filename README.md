# Brain Tumor Classification using Cost-sensitive Neural Networks and Transfer Learning

readme under construction


Currently, diagnosis and categorization of brain tumors are still reliant on histopathological eval-
uation of biopsy samples. Current methods are intrusive, time demanding,
and subject to human error. These drawbacks highlight the critical nature of developing an au-
tomated system to classify brain tumors using deep learning. This research aims to develop a
binary classification system for the early diagnosis of the most common malignant (cancerous)
tumor using a cost-sensitive convolutional neural network and transfer learning with EfficientNet
architecture.
